# Video Upload Persistence Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: When a user uploads a video in the product form, then goes to upload/crop images, the video disappears when returning to the product form.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by improper state management between the VideoUploader component and the Products component:

1. **Internal State Conflicts**: VideoUploader had its own internal `selectedFile` state that wasn't synchronized with the parent component's `selectedVideoFile` state.

2. **Modal Close Logic**: The `handleCloseModal` function was resetting `selectedVideoFile` even when just canceling image cropping (not actually closing the modal).

3. **State Isolation**: The VideoUploader's internal state was lost during parent component re-renders caused by image cropping navigation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Unified State Management**
- Removed internal `selectedFile` state from VideoUploader
- VideoUploader now receives `selectedVideoFile` as a prop from parent
- Parent (Products component) manages all video state centrally

### 2. **Enhanced VideoUploader Props**
```typescript
interface VideoUploaderProps {
  onVideoSelect: (file: File) => void;
  onVideoRemove: () => void;
  maxDurationSeconds: number;
  currentVideo?: string;
  selectedVideoFile?: File | null; // New prop for parent-managed state
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

### 3. **Smart Modal Handling**
Updated `handleCloseModal` logic:
- When cropping images: Only cancels crop, preserves video and form data
- When actually closing modal: Resets all states including video

### 4. **Preview URL Management**
Added useEffect to properly manage video preview URLs:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedFile && !videoPreview) {
    setVideoPreview(URL.createObjectURL(selectedFile));
  } else if (!selectedFile && videoPreview) {
    URL.revokeObjectURL(videoPreview);
    setVideoPreview(null);
  }
}, [selectedFile, videoPreview]);
```

## Technical Changes

### VideoUploader Component (`src/components/ui/VideoUploader.tsx`)
- **State Externalization**: Moved file state management to parent component
- **Preview Synchronization**: Added useEffect to sync preview URLs with parent state
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of blob URLs

### Products Component (`src/pages/dashboard/Products.tsx`)
- **Centralized Video State**: All video state managed in one place
- **Improved Modal Logic**: Distinguishes between crop cancellation and modal closure
- **State Preservation**: Video state persists during image cropping workflows

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix:
1. User uploads video ✅
2. User uploads/crops image ✅
3. Returns to product form ❌ Video disappeared
4. User frustrated, needs to re-upload video

### After Fix:
1. User uploads video ✅
2. User uploads/crops image ✅
3. Returns to product form ✅ Video still there
4. User can complete product creation seamlessly

## Benefits

- **Seamless Workflow**: Videos persist throughout the entire product creation process
- **Better UX**: No need to re-upload videos after image operations
- **State Consistency**: Video state properly synchronized across components
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cleanup of video preview URLs
- **Robust Navigation**: Modal operations don't interfere with video state

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Upload**: Upload video → Should persist in form
2. **Image After Video**: Upload video → Upload/crop image → Video should remain
3. **Multiple Images**: Upload video → Upload multiple images → Video should remain
4. **Cancel Crop**: Upload video → Start image crop → Cancel → Video should remain
5. **Complete Product**: Upload video → Add images → Save product → All data preserved

## Implementation Notes

- Video state is now managed at the Products component level
- VideoUploader acts as a controlled component
- Preview URLs are properly managed to prevent memory leaks
- Modal navigation preserves all form data during image operations
- Backward compatible with existing video functionality
