## ✅ What's Been Completed

Your Tradyng platform now has a complete email system with:

1. **OTP Registration Emails** - 6-digit codes that expire in 24 hours
2. **Order Confirmation Emails** - Sent to customers when they place orders
3. **Owner Notification Emails** - Sent to store owners when orders are received
4. **Order Approval Emails** - Sent to customers with PDF receipts when orders are approved
5. **Delivery Confirmation Emails** - Sent when orders are marked as delivered
6. **Welcome Emails** - Sent when customers successfully register

## 🧪 Test Your Email Integration

### Step 1: Add Your SendGrid API Key

1. Go to your SendGrid account: https://app.sendgrid.com
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Copy your API key (starts with "SG." and is about 69 characters long)
4. Open the `.env` file in your project root
5. Replace this line:
   ```
   VITE_SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.paste_your_real_api_key_here
   ```
   With your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 2: Update Test Email Address

1. Open `simple-sendgrid-test.js`
2. Find this line: `to: 'test@example.com',`
3. Replace with your email address: `to: 'your_email@example.com',`

### Step 3: Run the Test

```bash
node simple-sendgrid-test.js
```
