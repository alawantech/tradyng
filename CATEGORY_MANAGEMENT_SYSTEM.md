### 3. **Default Categories**
- Pre-populated with common categories for new businesses
- Industry-standard categories like Fashion, Electronics, etc.

### 4. **Business-Specific Categories**
- Categories are scoped to each business
- Each business has their own category list
- No cross-contamination between businesses

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### CategorySelector (`src/components/ui/CategorySelector.tsx`)
**Props:**
- `value: string` - Current selected category
- `onChange: (category: string) => void` - Callback when category changes
- `businessId: string` - Business ID for scoping categories
- `placeholder?: string` - Input placeholder text
- `disabled?: boolean` - Disable the component

**Features:**
- Searchable dropdown with filtering
- Create new category inline
- Keyboard navigation (Enter to create/select, Escape to close)
- Click outside to close
- Loading states and error handling

#### CategoryService (`src/services/category.ts`)
**Methods:**
- `getCategoriesByBusinessId()` - Fetch categories for a business
- `createCategory()` - Create new category (with duplicate check)
- `getCategoryByName()` - Find specific category by name
- `getDefaultCategories()` - Get predefined categories list
- `initializeDefaultCategories()` - Set up defaults for new business

### Database Structure

#### Categories Collection
```typescript
interface Category {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  businessId: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

#### Firestore Path
```
categories/{categoryId}
  - name: "Fashion"
  - businessId: "business123"
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp
```

#### Indexes
- Composite index on `businessId` (ASC) + `name` (ASC) for efficient querying
