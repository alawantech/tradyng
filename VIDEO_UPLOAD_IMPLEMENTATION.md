# Video Upload Implementation for Trady.ng

## Overview
Video upload functionality has been implemented for Business and Pro plan users, allowing them to add product videos with plan-specific duration limits.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Video Upload Service** (`src/services/videoUpload.ts`)
- **File Validation**: Validates video format (MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV) and file size (max 50MB)
- **Duration Detection**: Automatically detects video duration using HTML5 video element
- **Firebase Integration**: Uploads videos to Firebase Storage with proper path organization
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Can generate video thumbnails for preview (future use)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for upload failures

### 2. **Video Uploader Component** (`src/components/ui/VideoUploader.tsx`)
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Professional file selection interface
- **Live Validation**: Real-time validation of file format, size, and duration
- **Plan Enforcement**: Respects plan limits (30s for Business, 60s for Pro)
- **Preview Functionality**: Shows video preview with playback controls
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear upload progress and status indicators
- **Replace/Remove Options**: Easy video management with replace and remove functions

### 3. **Products Dashboard Integration**
- **Plan-Based Access**: Video upload only available for Business and Pro plans
- **Duration Limits**: 
  - **Business Plan**: 30 seconds maximum
  - **Pro Plan**: 60 seconds maximum
  - **Free Plan**: No video support
- **Upload Progress**: Integrated upload progress in product creation/editing flow
- **Validation Messages**: Clear error messages for plan limit violations

## Technical Implementation

### Plan Limits Configuration
```typescript
// Business Plan
maxVideoLengthSeconds: 30

// Pro Plan  
maxVideoLengthSeconds: 60

// Free Plan
allowVideos: false
```

### Video Validation Process
1. **File Format Check**: Ensures video is in supported format
2. **File Size Check**: Validates file is under 50MB limit
3. **Duration Check**: Loads video metadata to check duration against plan limits
4. **Plan Permission**: Verifies user's plan allows video uploads

### Storage Organization
Videos are stored in Firebase Storage with the following path structure:
```
businesses/{businessId}/products/{timestamp}_{filename}
```

## User Experience Flow

### For Business/Pro Plan Users:
1. **Upload Video**: Click to select video file or drag & drop
2. **Automatic Validation**: System validates format, size, and duration
3. **Preview**: Video preview shows before upload with playback controls
4. **Upload Progress**: Real-time upload progress feedback
5. **Management**: Easy replace or remove options

### For Free Plan Users:
- Video upload section is hidden
- Clear messaging about upgrade requirements
- Plan comparison shows video features

## Performance Considerations

### Upload Optimization:
- File validation before upload starts
- Progress feedback during upload
- Proper error handling and cleanup
- Memory management for video previews

### Storage Efficiency:
- Organized file paths
- Thumbnail generation capability
- Cleanup on product deletion

## Security Features

### Validation Layers:

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
